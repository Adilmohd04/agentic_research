# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Agentic Research Copilot is a multi-agent AI system powered by Model Context Protocol (MCP) that combines specialized agent coordination, context awareness, retrieval-augmented generation with citations, and developer copilot features. The system acts as both a research assistant and development companion, capable of searching, analyzing, generating cited content, and proposing code changes through a web application with optional voice interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Agent Coordination System

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to coordinate multiple specialized AI agents so that complex tasks can be broken down and handled by the most appropriate agent for each subtask.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a complex task THEN the Coordinator agent SHALL analyze the task and delegate appropriate subtasks to specialized agents
2. WHEN agents complete their subtasks THEN the Coordinator SHALL merge results and ensure workflow progress
3. WHEN multiple agents are working THEN the system SHALL maintain role-aware context where each agent tailors actions based on its purpose
4. IF an agent fails to complete a subtask THEN the Coordinator SHALL reassign or handle the failure gracefully
5. WHEN all subtasks are complete THEN the Coordinator SHALL synthesize a final response

### Requirement 2: Specialized Agent Roles

**User Story:** As a user, I want different types of specialized agents so that each aspect of my request is handled by an agent optimized for that specific task.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN research is needed THEN the Researcher agent SHALL search documents and web sources to retrieve relevant information
2. WHEN analysis is required THEN the Analyzer agent SHALL validate evidence, cluster insights, and check accuracy
3. WHEN output formatting is needed THEN the Executor agent SHALL format results, write code diffs, and generate reports
4. WHEN coordination is required THEN the Coordinator agent SHALL break down tasks and manage workflow between other agents

### Requirement 3: Context Awareness and Memory

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to remember previous interactions and maintain context so that I don't have to repeat information and agents can build on previous work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any interaction occurs THEN the system SHALL store it in structured memory with role, content, timestamp, and metadata
2. WHEN an agent starts a task THEN it SHALL have access to relevant conversation history and context
3. WHEN multiple interactions occur THEN agents SHALL know what's already been done and what remains
4. IF context becomes too large THEN the system SHALL intelligently summarize or compress older context while preserving key information

### Requirement 4: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Citations

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the system to provide accurate, cited information from reliable sources so that I can trust and verify the information provided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing research THEN the system SHALL use hybrid retrieval combining vector search and BM25
2. WHEN retrieving information THEN the system SHALL rerank results to get top-K most relevant passages
3. WHEN providing answers THEN the system SHALL include inline citations with confidence scores
4. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL ensure all claims are backed by retrievable sources
5. IF no reliable sources are found THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate uncertainty or lack of evidence

### Requirement 5: Developer Copilot Features

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to analyze my code repository and propose improvements so that I can enhance code quality and productivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a repository THEN the system SHALL provide read-only introspection of file tree and AST parsing
2. WHEN code improvements are needed THEN the system SHALL propose diffs with clear explanations
3. WHEN test coverage is lacking THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate unit tests
4. WHEN documentation is missing THEN the system SHALL draft relevant documentation
5. WHEN PR creation is requested THEN the system SHALL draft pull requests with proper descriptions
6. IF auto-merge is attempted THEN the system SHALL require human approval and never auto-merge changes

### Requirement 6: Voice Multimodal Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with the system using voice commands so that I can work hands-free and have a more natural interaction experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN voice input is provided THEN the system SHALL convert speech to text accurately
2. WHEN responding to voice queries THEN the system SHALL provide text-to-speech output
3. WHEN voice interaction is active THEN the system SHALL support barge-in functionality
4. WHEN voice sessions occur THEN the system SHALL log transcripts with linked citations
5. IF voice recognition fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to text input

### Requirement 7: Web Application Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want a web-based interface to interact with the system so that I can access it from any browser and have a rich interactive experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application THEN the user SHALL see a chat interface for text-based interaction
2. WHEN agents are working THEN the system SHALL display an agent trace dashboard showing coordination steps
3. WHEN research is completed THEN the system SHALL generate downloadable reports in Markdown or PDF format
4. WHEN citations are provided THEN they SHALL be clickable and lead to source materials
5. IF the interface becomes unresponsive THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options

### Requirement 8: MCP Integration and Tool Access

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to use Model Context Protocol for tool access so that integrations are standardized, auditable, and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents need to access external tools THEN they SHALL use MCP as the interface layer
2. WHEN file operations are needed THEN the system SHALL use MCP-standardized file access tools
3. WHEN database queries are required THEN the system SHALL use MCP-compliant database connectors
4. WHEN tool usage occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain audit logs for security and debugging
5. IF MCP tools fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 9: Enterprise Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As an enterprise user, I want role-based access control and secure handling of sensitive information so that confidential data remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing enterprise documents THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based access control (RBAC)
2. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL ensure proper encryption and secure storage
3. WHEN providing citations THEN the system SHALL only reference documents the user has permission to access
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt
5. WHEN audit trails are needed THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging of all data access

### Requirement 10: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to respond quickly and handle multiple concurrent requests so that my productivity isn't hindered by slow responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN simple queries are made THEN the system SHALL respond within 3 seconds
2. WHEN complex multi-agent tasks are executed THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators
3. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN it SHALL handle concurrent requests without degradation
4. WHEN vector searches are performed THEN they SHALL complete within 2 seconds for typical document collections
5. IF system load is high THEN the system SHALL gracefully queue requests and inform users of expected wait times
